This is just a repository for playing around with React, TypeScript, HMR, ...

It's based on the ejected version from [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript), adjusted to my personal preferences.

Might add more reasonable content in case it get's more production-ready ;)
